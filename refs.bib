abstract = {In this review article, we discuss the current status of particle dark matter, including experimental evidence and theoretical motivations. We discuss a wide array of candidates for particle dark matter, but focus on neutralinos in models of supersymmetry and Kaluzaâ€“Klein dark matter in models of universal extra dimensions. We devote much of our attention to direct and indirect detection techniques, the constraints placed by these experiments and the reach of future experimental efforts.}

    abstract={This article presents an extensive review of the status of the search of the dark matter. The first eight sections are devoted to topics in dark matter and its experimental searches, and the rest to selected topics in astrophysics and cosmology, which are intended to supply some of the needed background for students in particle physics. Sections 9 and 13 are introductory cosmology. The three astrophysical topics, Big Bang nucleosynthesis Section 10, Boltzmann transport equation and freeze out of massive particles Section 11, and CMB anisotropy Section 12 can all be studied in analytical approaches when reasonable approximations are made. Their original analytically forms, to which this article follows very closely, were given by particle physicists. Dark matter is an evolving subject requiring timely update to stay current. Hence a review of such a subject matter would undoubtedly have something wanting when it appears in print. It is hoped that this review can form a humble basis for those graduate students who would like to pursue the subject of dark matter. The reader can use the extensive table of contents to see in some details the materials covered in the article.}

    abstract = {Strict criteria are applied to the sample of spiral galaxies with measured rotation curves in order to select those objects for which the observed rotation curve is an accurate tracer of the radial force law. The resulting sub-sample of 10 galaxies is then considered in view of two suggested explanations for the discrepancy between the luminous mass and the conventional dynamical mass of galaxies: dark haloes and the modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). This is done by means of least-squares fits to the rotation curves. Three-parameter dark-halo models (M/L for the visible disc, the core radius and the asymptotic circular velocity of the halo) work well in reproducing the observed rotation curves, and it is found that, for the higher luminosity galaxies, the visible matter dominates the mass distribution within the optically bright disc. However, in the low-luminosity gas-rich dwarfs the dark component is everywhere dominant. MOND, with one free parameter, (M/L for the visible disc) generally works well in predicting the form of the rotation curves, in some cases better than multi-parameter dark-halo fits. If the distance to the galaxy is also taken as a free parameter, then the MOND fits are as good as three parameter dark-halo models and, with one exception, the implied distances are consistent with the adopted distances within the probable uncertainty in the distance estimates. Restricting the number of parameter in dark-halo models by making use of the disc-halo coupling does not produce satisfactory fits to the rotation curves. The overall conclusion is that MOND is currently the best phenomenological description of the systematics of the discrepancy in galaxies.},

The rotation curve keeps rising out to the last measured point and implies a dark halo mass ≳5×1010 M⊙. The stellar and gaseous discs provide virtually equal contributions to the galaxy gravitational potential at large galactocentric radii, but no obvious correlation is found between the radial distribution of dark matter and the distribution of stars or gas.Results of the best fit to the mass distribution in M33 picture a dark halo which controls the gravitational potential from 3 kpc outward, with a matter density which decreases radially as R−1.3. The density profile is consistent with the theoretical predictions for structure formation in hierarchical clustering cold dark matter (CDM) models, and favours lower mass concentrations than those expected in the standard cosmogony.}},
