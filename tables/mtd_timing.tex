    \caption{ Timing summaries for analyses for serial and multithreaded processes. M tasks is the number of functional-parallel tasks ran for the computation. $T_{p,c}$ is a single run time in hours:minutes:seconds for runs utilizing $p$ nodes and $c$ threads. Runs are run interactively on the same computer to maximize consistency. Empty entries are indicated with '-'. $(\cdot)$ entries are estimated entries extrapolated from data earlier in the column.}\label{tab:mtd_timing_study}
