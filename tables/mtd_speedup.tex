    \caption{ Speed up summaries for analyses for serial and multithreaded processes. M tasks is the number of functional-parallel tasks ran for the computation. $S_{p,c}$ is a single speedup comparison for runs utilizing $p$ nodes and $c$ threads. $[\cdot]$ are the estimated speedups calculated from \cref{tab:mtd_timing_study}, \cref{eq:specificFs}, and \cref{eq:amdahlSpeed}. Empty entries are indicated with '-'.}\label{tab:mtd_speedup_study}
