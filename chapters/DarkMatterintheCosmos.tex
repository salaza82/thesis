\section{Introduction\label{sec:intro2dm}}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

The dark matter problem can be summarized in part by the following thought experiment.

Let us say you are the teacher for an elementary school classroom.
You take them on a field trip to your local science museum and among the exhibits is one for mass and weight.
The exhibit has a gigantic scale, and you come up with a fun problem for your class.

You ask your class, "What is the total weight of the classroom?
Give your best estimation to me in 30 minutes, and then we'll check your guess on the scale.
If your guess is within 10\% of the right answer, we will stop for ice cream on the way back."

The students are ecstatic to hear this, and they get to work.
The solution is some variation of the following strategy.
The students should give each other their weight or best guess if they do not know.
Then, all they need to do is add each student's weight and get a grand total for the class.
The measurement on the giant scale should show the true weight of the class.
When comparing the measured weight to your estimation, multiply the measurement by 1.0 $\pm$~0.1 to get the $\pm$10\% tolerances for your estimation.

Two of your students, Sandra and Mario, return to you with a solution.

They say, "We weren't sure of everyone's weight.
We used 65 lbs for the people we didn't know and added everyone who does know.
There are 30 of us, and we got 2,000 lbs!
That's a ton!"

You estimated 1,900 lbs. assuming the average weight of a student in your class was 60 lbs.
So, you are pleased with Sandra's and Mario's answer.
You instruct your students to all gather on the giant scale and read off the weight together.
To all your surprise, the scale reads \textit{10,000 lbs}!
10,000, in technical terms, is significantly more than a 10\% error from 2,000.
In fact, it is approximately 5 times more massive than either your or your students' estimates.
You think to yourself and conclude there must be something wrong with the scale.
You ask an employee to check the scale and verify it is well calibrated.
They confirm that the scale is in working order.
You weigh a couple of students individually to assess for yourself that the scale is well calibrated.
Sandra weighs 59 lbs, and Mario weighs 62 lbs, typical weights for their age.
You then weigh each student individually and see that their weights individually do not deviate greatly from 60 lbs.
So, where does all the extra weight come from?
This dilemma is what we are faced with when weighing the cosmos.

This thought experiment serves as an analogy to the Dark Matter problem.
The important substitution to make however is to replace the students with stars and the classroom with a galaxy, say the Milky Way.
Individually the mass of stars is well measured and defined with the Sun as our nearest test case.
However, when we set out to measure the mass of a collection of stars as large as galaxies, our well-motivated estimation is wildly incorrect.
There simply is no way to account for this discrepancy except without some unseen, or dark, contribution to mass and matter in galaxies.
I set out in my thesis to narrow the possibilities of what this Dark Matter could be.

\section{Dark Matter Basics\label{sec:basicDM}}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

Presently, a compelling theory of cosmology that includes Dark Matter (DM) in order to explain a variety of observations is $\Lambda$ \textbf{C}old \textbf{D}ark \textbf{M}atter, or \lcdm.
I present the evidence supporting \lcdm~in \Cref{sec:evidence4dm} yet discuss the conclusions of the \lcdm~model here.
According to \lcdm~fits to observations on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), DM is 26.8\% of the universe's current energy budget.
Baryonic matter, stuff like atoms, gas, and stars, contributes to 4.9\% of the universe's current energy budget \cite{Greene:cosmology_dm,Young:cosmology_dm,Bertone:particleDM}.

% A note on the above, the number is usually quoted as some \Omega_{f} h^_2. In order to get the percentages yourself, you need to actually multiply h which is the hubble expansion rate.

DM is dark; it does not interact readily with light at any wavelength.
DM also does not interact noticeably with the other standard model forces (Strong and Weak) at a rate that is readily observed \cite{Bertone:particleDM}.
DM is cold, which is to say that the average velocity of DM is below relativistic speeds \cite{Greene:cosmology_dm}.
`Hot' DM would not likely manifest the dense structures we observe like galaxies, and instead would produce much more diffuse galaxies than what is observed \cite{Bertone:particleDM,Greene:cosmology_dm}.
DM is old; it played a critical role in the formation of the universe and the structures within it \cite{Greene:cosmology_dm,Young:cosmology_dm}.

Observations of DM have so far been only gravitational.
The parameter space available to what DM could be is therefore extremely broad.
The broad DM parameter space is iteratively tested in DM searches by supposing a hypothesis that has not yet been ruled out and performing observations to test them.
When the observations yield a null result, the parameter space is constrained further.
I present some approaches for DM searches in \Cref{sec:dm_search}.

\section{Evidence for Dark Matter}\label{sec:evidence4dm}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

Dark Matter (DM) has been a looming problem in physics for almost 100 years.
Anomalies have been observed by astrophysicists in galactic dynamics as early as 1933 when Fritz Zwicky noticed unusually large velocity dispersion in the Coma cluster.
Zwicky's measurement was the first recorded to use the Virial theorem to measure the mass fraction of visible and invisible matter in celestial bodies~\cite{Hooper:DMHistory}.
From Zwicky in \cite{Zwicky:1933}, "\textit{If this would be confirmed, we would get the surprising result that dark matter is present in much greater amount than luminous matter.}"
Zwicky's and others' observation did not instigate a crisis in astrophysics because the measurements did not entirely conflict with their understanding of galaxies \cite{Hooper:DMHistory}.
In 1978, Rubin, Ford, and Norbert measured rotation curves for ten spiral galaxies \cite{Rubin:1978}.
Rubin et al.'s 1978 publication presented a major challenge to the conventional understanding of galaxies that could no longer be dismissed by measurement uncertainties.
Evidence has been mounting ever since for this exotic form of matter.
The following subsections provide three compelling pieces of evidence in support of the existence of DM.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%
\subsection{First Clues: Stellar Velocities\label{sec:ev4dm_stars}}
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%

Zwicky, and later Rubin, measured the stellar velocities of various galaxies to estimate their virial mass.
The Virial Theorem upon which these observations are interpreted is written as \virialtheorem
Where \textit{T} is the kinetic energy and \textit{V} is the potential energy in a self-gravitating system.
The classical Newton's law of gravity from stars and gas was used for the gravitational potential modeled in the observed galaxies:
\newtongravity
Here $m_{i,j}$ are the \textit{i}th or \textit{j}th masses of the $i$th or $j$th star in the cluster.
$r_{ij}$ is the distance between these two stars.
Zwicky et al. measured just apparent velocities of stars apparent from optical observations which provides a measure for $T$ \cite{Zwicky:1933}.
Rubin et al. added to this by measuring the velocity of the hydrogen gas via the 21 cm emission line of Hydrogen \cite{Rubin:1978}.
The velocities of the stars and gas are used to infer the total mass of galaxies and galaxy clusters via \Cref{eq:virialtheorem}.
An inferred mass is obtained from the luminosity of the selected sources.
The two inferences are compared to each other as a luminosity ($L$) to virial mass ($M$) ratio which typically yielded \cite{Greene:cosmology_dm}
\masslightratio
with $M_{\sun}$ and $L_{\sun}$ referring to stellar mass and stellar luminosity, respectively.
These observations clearly indicate a discrepancy in mass from apparent light and mass inferred from the velocity of stars and gas.

Rubin et al. \cite{Rubin:1978} demonstrated that the discrepancy was unlikely to be an underestimation of the mass of the stars and gas.
The inferred "dark" mass was up to 5 times more than the luminous mass.
This dark mass also needed to extend well beyond the extent of the luminous matter.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \centering{
    \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{figures/NGC6503_rotcurve.png}
    \caption{Stellar velocity curve fit to NGC 6503 from \cite{Begeman:rot_curves}. Dashed line is the contribution from visible matter. Dotted curves are from gas. Dash-dot curves are from dark matter (DM). Solid line is the composite contribution from all matter and DM sources. Data are indicated with bold dots with error bars. Data agree strongly with a matter + DM composite prediction.}
    \label{fig:gal_rot_curve}
    }
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:gal_rot_curve} features one of many rotation curves plotted from the stellar velocities within galaxies.
The measured rotation curves mostly feature a flattening of velocities at larder radii which is not expected if the gravity was only coming from luminous matter.
The extension of the flat velocity region also indicates that the DM is distributed far from the center of the galaxy.
Modern velocity measurements include significantly larger objects, galactic clusters, and smaller objects, dwarf galaxies.
Yet, measurements along this regime are leveraging the Virial theorem with Newtonian potential energies.
However, we know Newtonian gravity is not a comprehensive description of gravity.
New observational techniques have been developed since 1978, and those are discussed in the following sections.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%
\subsection{Evidence for Dark Matter: Gravitational Lensing\label{sec:ev4dm_lens}}
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%

Modern evidence for dark matter comes from new avenues beyond stellar velocities.
Gravitational lensing from DM is one of these channels from general relativity.
General relativity predicts aberrations in light caused by massive objects.
In recent decades we have been able to measure the lensing effects from compact objects and DM halos.
\Cref{fig:grav_lensing_explained} shows how different massive objects change the final image of a faraway galaxy resulting from gravitational lensing.

\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.17]{figures/heic0404b.jpg}
        \caption{Light from a distant galaxy is bent in unique ways depending on the distribution of mass between the galaxy and Earth. Yellow dashed lines indicate where the light would have gone if the matter were not present. Solid yellow is the path the light actually traverses \cite{eas:grav_lensing}. Spherical densities deform the light to creates a halo around the originating source. Ellipsoidal densities will create nodes in the image. Clumpy aggregations will manifest as complex light streams and aberrations in an image.}
        \label{fig:grav_lensing_explained}
    }
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.425]{figures/bullet_cluster.png}
        \caption{(left) Optical image of galactic cluster 1E0657-558. (right) X-ray image of the cluster with redder meaning hotter and higher baryon density. (both) Green contours are the reconstructed gravity contours from weak lensing. White rings are the best fit mass maxima at 68.3\%, 95.5\%, and 99.7\% confidence. The matter maxima of the clusters are clearly separated from x-ray maxima. \cite{Clowe:BulletCluster}}
        \label{fig:bullet_cluster}
    }
\end{figure}

Gravitational lensing provides additional compelling evidence for DM.
The observation of two merging galactic clusters in 2006, shown in \Cref{fig:bullet_cluster}, provided a compelling argument for DM outside the Standard Model.
These clusters merged recently in astrophysical time scales.
Galaxies and star cluster have mostly passed by each other as the likelihood of stars colliding within them is low.
Therefore, these massive objects will mostly track the highest mass, dark and/or baryonic, density.
Yet, the intergalactic gas is responsible for the majority of the baryonic mass in the systems \cite{Hooper:DMHistory}.
These gas bodies will not phase through so heat up and compress as they collide together.
The hot gas is located via x-ray emission from the cluster.
Two observations of the clusters were performed independently of each other.

The first was the lensing of light around the galaxies due to their gravitational influences.
When celestial bodies are large enough, the gravity they exert bends space and time itself.
The warped space-time lenses light and will deflect in an analogous way to how glass lenses will bend light, see \Cref{fig:grav_lensing_explained}.
With a sufficient understanding of light sources behind a massive object, we can reconstruct the contours of the gravitational lenses.
The gradient of the contours shown in \Cref{fig:bullet_cluster} then indicates how dense the matter is and where it is.
In the absence of DM, it should also map out where the majority of the mass is.

The x-ray emission is then be observed from the clusters.
Since these galaxies are mostly gas and are merging, the gas should be getting hotter.
If they are merging, the x-ray emissions should be the strongest where the gas is mostly moving through each other.
Hence, X-ray emission maps out where the gas is in the merging galaxy cluster.

The lensing and x-ray observations were done on the Bullet cluster which are featured on \cref{fig:bullet_cluster} \cite{Clowe:BulletCluster}.
The x-ray emissions do not at all align with the gravitational contours.
The incongruence in mass density and baryon density suggests that there is a lot of matter somewhere that does not interact with light.
Moreover, this DM cannot be baryonic \cite{Clowe:BulletCluster}.
The Bullet Cluster measurement did not really tell us what DM is exactly, but it did give the clue that DM also does not interact with itself very strongly.
If DM did interact strongly with itself, then it would have been more aligned with the x-ray emission \cite{Clowe:BulletCluster}.
There have been follow-up studies of galaxy clusters with similar results.
The Bullet Cluster and others like it provide a persuasive case against something possibly amiss in our gravitational theories.

\subsection{Evidence for Dark Matter: Cosmic Microwave Background\label{sec:ev4dm_cmb}}
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.215]{figures/Planck_CMB_pillars.jpg}
        \caption{Plank CMB sky. Sky map features small variations in temperature in primordial light. These anisotropies are used to make inferences about the universe's energy budget and developmental history. \cite{Plank:CMB}}
        \label{fig:CMB}
    }
\end{figure}

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) is the primordial light from the early universe when Hydrogen atoms formed from the combination of free electron and proton soup in the early universe.
Prior to this recombination, the universe was too hot to form atoms and was opaque to light.
The CMB is the earliest light we can observe; released when the universe was about 380,000 years old.
Then we look at how the simulated universes look like compared to what we see.
\Cref{fig:CMB} is the most recent CMB image from the Plank satellite after subtracting the average value and masking the galactic plane \cite{Plank:CMB}.
Redder regions indicate a slightly hotter region in the CMB, and blue indicates colder.
The intensity variations are on the order of 1 in 1000 with respect to the average value.

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.4]{figures/multipole.png}
        \caption{Observed Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum as a function of multipole moment from Plank observatory \cite{Plank:CMB}. Blue line is the best fit model from \lcdm. Red points and lines are data and error, respectively. }
        \label{fig:multipole}
    }
\end{figure}

The Cosmic Microwave Background shows that the universe had DM in it from an incredibly early stage.
To measure the DM, Dark Energy, and matter fractions of the universe from the CMB, the image is analyzed into a power spectrum, which shows the amplitude of the fluctuations as a function of spherical multipole moments ($l$).
\lcdm~provides the best fit to the power spectra of the CMB as shown in \cref{fig:multipole}.
The CMB power spectrum is quite sensitive to the fraction of each energy contribution in the early universe.
Low \textit{l} modes are dominated by variations in gravitational potential.
Intermediate \textit{l} emerge from oscillations in the photon-baryon fluid from competing baryon pressures and gravity.
High \textit{l} is a damped region from the diffusion of photons during electron-proton recombination. \cite{Greene:cosmology_dm}

\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.285]{figures/LCDM_multipole/frame_00_delay-0.2s.png}\hfill
        \includegraphics[scale=0.285]{figures/LCDM_multipole/frame_06_delay-0.2s.png}\hfill
        \includegraphics[scale=0.285]{figures/LCDM_multipole/frame_16_delay-0.2s.png}
        \caption{Predicted power spectra of CMB for different $\Omega_m h^2$ values for fixed baryon density from \cite{waynehu:dm_anim}. (left) Low $\Omega_m h^2$ increases the prominence of first and second peaks. (middle) $\Omega_m h^2$ is most similar to the observed power spectrum. The second and third peaks are similar in height. (right) $\Omega_mh^2$ is large which suppresses the first peak and raises the prominence of the third peak.}
        \label{fig:CMB_vibratemodes}
    }
\end{figure}

The harmonics would look quite different for a universe with less DM.
\Cref{fig:CMB_vibratemodes} demonstrates the effect $\Omega_m h^2$, the mass fraction, has on the expected power spectrum for fixed baryon matter density. \cite{waynehu:dm_anim}
Sweeping  $\Omega_m h^2$ while keeping the baryon mass fraction fixed clearly shows the effect dark matter has on the CMB power spectrum.
The observations fit well with the \lcdm~model, and the derived fractions are as follows.
The matter fraction: $\Omega_m = 0.3153$; and the baryon fraction: $\Omega_b = 0.04936$ \cite{Plank:CMB}.
Plank's observations also provide a measure of the Hubble constant, $H_0$.
$H_0$ especially has seen a growing tension in the past decade that continues to deepened with observations from instruments like the James Webb Telescope \cite{JWST:hubble_tension,Freedman:hubble_tension}.
As Hubble tensions deepen, we may find that perhaps \lcdm, despite its successes, is missing some critical physics.

Overall, the Newtonian motion of stars in galaxies, weak lensing from galactic clusters, and power spectra from primordial light form a compelling body of research in favor of dark matter.
It takes another leap of theory and experimentation to make observations of DM that are non-gravitational in nature.
In \cref{sec:evidence4dm}, the evidence for DM implies strongly that the DM is matter and not a lost parameter in the gravitational fields between massive objects.
In there was a failure in our gravitational modeling, we would not see lensing at the strength observed by \cref{fig:bullet_cluster} \cite{Clowe:BulletCluster} so far from the baryons mass.
Additionally, the multipole peaks corresponding to the matter fraction, see \cref{fig:CMB_vibratemodes} occur with DM as matter.
The peaks would soften significantly if DM were a shortfall in gravitational modeling.
Finally, if we take one axiom: that this matter has quantum behavior, such as being described by some Bohr wavelength and abiding by some fermion or boson statistics; then we arrive at particle dark matter.
One particle DM hypothesis is the Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP).
This DM candidate theory is discussed further in the next section and is the focus of this thesis.

\section{Searching for Dark Matter: Particle DM}\label{sec:dm_search}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.225]{figures/SM.jpg}
    }
    \caption{The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Figure taken from \cite{sm_table}}
    \label{fig:SM}
\end{figure}

\Cref{fig:SM} shows the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, that is currently the most accurate model for the dynamics of fundamental particles like electrons and photons.
The current status of the SM does not have a viable DM candidate.
When looking at the standard model, we can immediately exclude any charged particle because charged particles interact strongly with light.
Specifically, this will rule out the following charged, fundamental particles: $e,\mu, \tau, W, u, d, s, c, t, b$ and their corresponding antiparticles.
Recalling from \cref{sec:basicDM} that DM must be long-lived and stable over the age of the universe, we exclude all SM particles with decay half-lives at or shorter than the age of the universe.
The lifetime constraint additionally eliminates the $Z$ and $H$ bosons.
Finally, the candidate DM needs to be somewhat massive.
Recall from \Cref{sec:basicDM} that DM is cold or not relativistic through the universe.
This eliminates the remaining SM particles: $\nu_{e, \mu, \tau}, g, \gamma$ as DM candidates.
Because there are no DM candidates within the SM, the DM problem strongly hints to physics Beyond the SM (BSM).

As we are in a BSM regime, the parameter space for DM is vast.
Unconstrained particle models include very low mass hypotheses such as Axion-like Particles at $m_\chi \le 1$~eV.

%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.38]{figures/DM_with_SM.png}
        \caption{Simplified Feynman diagram demonstrating the different ways DM can interact with SM particles. The 'X's refer to the DM particles whereas the SM refer to fundamental particles in the SM. The large circle in the center indicates the vertex of interaction and is purposely left vague. The colored arrows refer to different directions of time as well as their respective labels.}
        \label{fig:break_it}
    }
\end{figure}

When considering DM that couples in some way with the SM, the interactions are roughly demonstrated by the interactions shown in \Cref{fig:break_it}.
The figure is a simplified Feynman diagram where the arrow of time represents the interaction modes of: \textbf{Shake it, Break it, Make it}.

\textbf{Shake it} refers to the direct detection of dark matter.
Direct detection interactions start with a free DM particle and a SM particle.
The DM and SM particle interact via elastic or inelastic collision and recoil away from each other.
The DM remains in the dark sector and imparts some momentum to the SM particle.
The hope is that the momentum imparted onto the SM particle is sufficiently high enough to be picked up with extremely sensitive instruments.
A direct detection experiment must wait until DM is incident on the detector.
Most direct detection experiments are therefore placed in low-background environments with inert detection media like the noble gas, Xenon. \cite{Cooley:dd_dm}

\textbf{Make it} refers to the production of DM from SM initial states.
The experiment starts with SM particles that are accelerated to incredibly high energies and then collided with each other.
In the confluence of energy, DM hopefully emerges as a byproduct of the SM annihilation.
Often it is the collider experiments that are energetic enough to hypothetically produce DM.
These experiments include the world-wide collaborations, ATLAS and CMS at CERN, where protons collide together at extreme energies.
DM likely does not interact with the detectors and lives long enough to escape their detection apparatus.
This means any DM production experiment searches for an excess of events with missing momentum or energy in the events.
An example event with missing transverse momentum is shown in \Cref{fig:met_atlas}.
The missing momentum with no particle tracks implies a weakly interacting particle carried the energy out of the detector.
However, there are other neutral particles in the SM, like neutrons or neutrinos, so any analysis has to account for SM signatures of missing momentum. \cite{atlas:met_dm_precise}

\subsection{Break it: Standard Model Signatures of Dark Matter through Indirect Searches\label{sec:break_it}}
%$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$%

\textbf{Break it} refers to the creation of SM particles from the dark sector, and it is the primary focus of this thesis.
The interaction begins with DM in the dark sector.
The hypothesis is that this DM will either annihilate with itself or decay and produce SM byproducts.
This method is often referred to as the Indirect Detection of DM because we have no lab to directly control or manipulate the DM.
Therefore, most indirect DM searches are performed using observations of known DM densities among astrophysical sources.
A strength is that we have the whole of the universe and its 13.6-billion-year lifespan to use as a detector and particle accelerator.
Additionally, locations of dark matter are well cataloged since it was astrophysical observations that presented the problem of DM in the first place.

\begin{figure}[ht]

        \label{fig:id_dm_ann}
    }
\end{figure}

However, anything can happen in the universe.
There are many difficult to deconvolve backgrounds when searching for DM.
One prominent example is the galactic center.
We know the galactic center has a large DM content because of stellar kinematics in our Milky Way and DM halo simulations.
Yet, any signal from the galactic center is challenging to parse apart from the extreme environment of our supermassive black hole, unresolved sources, and diffuse emission from the interstellar medium \cite{Tracy:les_houches}.
Despite the challenges, any DM model that yields evidence in the other two observation methods, \textbf{Shake it} or \textbf{Make it} must be corroborated with indirect observations of the known DM sources.
Without corroborating evidence, DM observation in the lab is hard-pressed to demonstrate that it is the model contributing to the DM seen at the universal scale.

In the case of Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) DM, signals are described in terms of primary SM particles produced from DM decay or annihilation.
The SM initial state particles are then simulated down to stable final states such as the $\gamma, \nu, p, \text{or } e$ which can traverse galactic lengths to reach the Earth.

\Cref{fig:id_dm_ann} shows the quagmire of SM particles that emerges from SM initial states that are not stable \cite{2021ICRC:glory_duck}.
There are many SM particles with varying energies that can be produced in such an interaction.
For any arbitrary DM source and stable SM particle, the SM flux from DM annihilating to a neutral particle in the SM, $\phi$, from a region in the sky is described by the following.
\iddmannilationPhi
In \cref{eq:id_dm_flux_phi}, \sv~is the velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section of DM to the SM.
$m_\chi$ refers to the mass of DM, noted with Greek letter $\chi$.
$\frac{dN_{\phi}}{dE_\phi}$ is the N particle flux weighted by the particle energy.
Example spectra are provided in \cref{fig:dm_decay_spectra} for the $\chi\chi \rightarrow$ \parpar{b} $\rightarrow \gamma$ final state.
The integrated terms are performed over the solid angle, $d\Omega$, and line of sight, l.o.s.
$\rho$ is the density of DM for a location $(r, \theta')$ in the sky.
The terms left of the '$\times$' are often referred to as the particle physics component.
The terms on the right are referred to as the astrophysical component.
For decaying DM, the equation changes to\dots
\iddmdecay

In \Cref{eq:id_dm_decay}, $\tau$ is the decay lifetime of the DM.
Just as in \cref{eq:id_dm_flux_phi}, the left and right terms are the particle physics and the astrophysical components respectively.
The integrated astrophysical component of \cref{eq:id_dm_flux} is often called the J-Factor.
Whereas the integrated astrophysical component of \cref{eq:id_dm_decay} is often called the D-Factor.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/bb_decay_hdm.png}
        \caption{Dark Matter (DM) decay spectrum for $b\bar{b}$ initial state and $\gamma$ final state. Redder spectra are for larger DM masses. Bluer spectra are light DM masses. $x$ is a unitless factor defined as the ratio of the mass of DM, $m_\chi$, and the final state particle energy $E_{\gamma}$. Figure from \cite{Rodd:HDM_spec}.}
        \label{fig:dm_decay_spectra}
    }
\end{figure}

The DM annihilation branching ratios in the SM are not known, so it is usually assumed that DM annihilates 100\% of the time into a given SM particle/anti-particle pair.
When a DM annihilation or decay produces one of the long-lived, neutral SM particles (neutrinos or photons), the particle can be traced back to the DM source.
For DM above GeV energies, there are very few SM processes that can produce particles with such a high energy.
Seeing such a signal would almost certainly be an indication of the presence of dark matter.
Fortunately, the universe  provides us with the largest volume and lifetime ever for a particle physics experiment.

The first detection of DM relied on optical observations.
Since then, we have developed new techniques to find DM dense regions.
As described in \cref{sec:ev4dm_stars}, many DM dense regions were discovered through observing galactic rotation curves.
Our Milky Way galaxy is among the known DM dense regions discovered, and it is the largest nearby DM dense region to look at.
Additionally, the DM halo surrounding the Milky Way is clumpy \cite{Tracy:les_houches}.
There are regions in the DM halo of the Milky Way that have more DM than others that have captured gas over time.
These sub-halos were dense enough to collapse gas and form stars.
These apparent sub galaxies are known as dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) and are the main sources studied in this thesis.
Each source type comes with different trade-offs.
Galactic Center studies will be very sensitive to the assumed distribution of DM.
The central DM density can vary substantially as demonstrated in \cref{fig:dm_profile}.
At distances close to the center of the galaxy, or small \textit{r}, the differences in DM densities can be 3-4 orders of magnitude.
Searches toward the galactic center will therefore be quite sensitive to the assumed DM distribution.

Searches dSphs suffer less from uncertainties in the DM density than the galactic center studies.
This is mostly from their diminutive size being smaller than the angular resolution of most high energy astrophysical observatories \cite{Tracy:les_houches}.
The DM content of dSphs are typically determined with the Virial theorem, \cref{eq:virialtheorem}, and are usually mostly DM \cite{Tracy:les_houches} in mass.
DSph's tend to be ideal sources to look at for DM searches.
Their environments are quiet with little astrophysical background.
Unlike the galactic center, the most energetic components of dSph's are the stars within them versus a violent accretion disc around a black hole.
All this together means that dSph's are among the best sources to look at for indirect DM searches.
dSph's are the targets of focus for this thesis.

\section{Multi-Messenger Dark Matter \label{sec:mult-messengerDM}}
%-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------%

Astrophysics entered a new phase in the past few decades that leverages our increasing sensitivity to SM channels and general relativity (GR).
Up until the 21st century, astrophysical observations were performed with photons ($\gamma$) only.
Astrophysics with this 'messenger' is fairly mature now.
Novel observations of the universe have since only adjusted the sensitivity of the wavelength of light that is observed except at MeV energies.
Gems like the CMB \cite{Plank:CMB}, and more have ultimately been observations of different wavelengths of light.
Multi-messenger astrophysics proposes using other SM particles such the $p^{+/-}$, neutrinos ($\nu$), or gravitational waves predicted by general relativity.
\Cref{fig:astrophysics_particles} provides a graphic of what kinds of paths stable particles in SM will take on their way to Earth.

    \caption{Stable SM Particles from astrophysical sources are deflected in different ways because of their intrinsic properties. Charged particles like cosmic rays ($p$) are charged and will be bent by magnetic fields as they traverse the universe. Neutrinos ($\nu$) and photons ($\gamma$) are neutral and can traverse almost unimpeded. Photons however can be occluded by dust and other massive objects. Figure from \cite{IceCube_SPGallery}.}
    \label{fig:astrophysics_particles}
\end{figure}

The experiment LIGO had a revolutionary discovery in 2016 with the first detection of a binary black hole merger \cite{2016:grav_waves}.
This opened the collective imagination to observing the universe through gravitational waves.
There has also been a surge of interest in the neutrino ($\nu$) sector.
The IceCube Neutrino Observatory demonstrated that we are sensitive to neutrinos in regions that correlate with significant photon emission like the galactic plane \cite{2023:IC3_galactic_plane}.
Neutrinos, like gravitational waves and light, travel mostly unimpeded from their source to our observatories.
This makes pointing to the originating source of these messengers much easier than it is for cosmic rays which are deflected from their source by magnetic fields.

\end{figure}

The IceCube collaboration recently published a groundbreaking result of the Milky Way in neutrinos.
The recent result from IceCube, shown in \Cref{fig:ic3_mw}, proves that we can make observations under different messenger regimes.
The top two panels show the appearance of the galactic plane to different wavelengths of light.
Some sources are more apparent in some panels, while others are not.
This new channel is powerful because neutrinos are readily able to penetrate through gas and dust in the Milky Way.
This new image also refines our understanding of how high energy particles are produced.
For example, the fit to IceCube data prefers neutrino production from the decay of $\pi^0$ \cite{2023:IC3_galactic_plane}.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering{
        \includegraphics[scale=0.65]{figures/pppc_spectra.png}
        \caption{Dark Matter annihilation spectra for different final state particles and standard model annihilation channels \cite{pppc}. Photons, $\gamma$, (red), electrons, $e^\pm$, (green), protons, $\bar{p}$, (blue), neutrinos, $\nu$ (black).}
        \label{fig:pppc_spectra}
    }
\end{figure}

Exposing our observations to more cosmic messengers greatly increases our sensitivity to rare processes.
In the case of DM, \Cref{fig:pppc_spectra},  there are many SM particles produced in DM annihilation.
Among the final state fluxes are gammas and neutrinos.
Charged particles are also produced however they would not likely make it to Earth since they will be deflected by magnetic fields between the source and Earth.
This means observatories that can see the neutral messengers are especially good for DM searches and for combining data for a multi-messenger DM search.
