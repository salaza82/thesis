\begin{abstract}

    This dissertation enhances the search for dark matter (DM) through a multi-wavelength and multi-messenger approach by combining data from leading gamma-ray and neutrino observatories.
    The first analysis combines data across five gamma-ray observatories, including the High Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory and four others.
    This foundational study probed the largest DM mass space that spans from 5 GeV up to 100 TeV.
    This collaboration  achieved a threefold improvement in sensitivity to DM annihilation from dwarf galaxies.
    The collaborative framework developed among these five experiments also set a goal for including neutrino observatories in DM searches.
    Though no significant dark matter signals were detected, more stringent upper limits were set on the velocity-weighted annihilation cross-section, \sv.

    A pivotal aspect of the research involved developing new analytical methods within the IceCube Neutrino Observatory that achieved an order of magnitude increase in sensitivity for heavy dark matter annihilation.
    These improvements set the stage for multi-messenger dark matter searches with IceCube and gamma-ray observations.

    Within HAWC, computational methods were optimized to speed up the analysis pipeline by an order of magnitude.
    HAWC is therefore able to take on more ambitious DM searches and observe many more potential DM sources.

    The combined efforts from HAWC and IceCube form the basis for a novel multi-messenger strategy to probe dark matter annihilation searches.
    The research culminates in a preliminary mock limit from HAWC data and IceCube simulation.
    These analyses showcase the enhanced capability of detecting dark matter in the mass region above 1 PeV.
    With these two instruments alone, we could see two to threefold improvement to our sensitivity to heavy dark matter compared to these observatories searching for DM independently.
    This dissertation presents a comprehensive multi-instrument and multi-wavelength approach that provides a robust framework for future dark matter research.
    This work will be the foundation for a multi-messenger approach in the pursuit of unveiling the universe's dark sector.

\chapter*{Acknowledgments}
\DoubleSpacing

This dissertation was ambitious and benefited greatly from support and love of my friends, family, and mentors.
These people believed in me at times when I found it hard to believe in myself.
Thank you so much, all of you, for encouraging me to follow my ambition and acheive great things.
Several of you come to mind and below I thank you individually in no particular order.

\textbf{My mentors}

Ben Hooberman, my undergraduate mentor who took a risk on an inexperienced undergraduate researcher.
He gave me the opertunities in physics I was craving and exposed me to the world of research.
The first of many doors opened when I started with Ben, and I am tremendously grateful.

Kirsten Tollefson, my graduate advisor and chair to my thesis committee.
She guided my ambitious program and kept me grounded.
Her direction and training taught me a lot about successful research and building strong, collaborative teams.
I will miss the days of gaming out research and project plans.
Thanks a ton for making graduate school a pleasant experience for me.

Pat Harding, member on my committee and mentor at Los Alamos National Lab.
I learned ways of thinking pragmatically towards solving problems with Pat.
He helped me lower the stakes and focused on the core goals in research.
Thanks for taking a chance on me and introducing me to Los Alamos, truly an enchanting place.

Mehr Nisa, previously a MSU postdoc, now faculty.
We arrived at MSU at about the same time and was the only postdoc/peer who was also working on both HAWC and IceCube.
Her expertise and guidance was critical in developing the ambitious research of this dissertation.
It's also been inspiring and a source of community to grow in our careers in parallel.
Thanks a ton for the mentorship, and supporting my many questions.

Jim Linneman, faculty at MSU in HAWC and rigorous physics mentor.
Jim has been a role model of scientific rigor who has guided my physics skillset since arriving at MSU.
He is among the most exposed to my research and has similarly enabled my ambition.
It's been a pleasure to work with Jim and I thank you tremendously for your input to my research.

Thank you to Kendall Mahn, who saw my potential from the moment of application to MSU.
You cultivated the fight in me that's been exersized in leadership positions at MSU.

Thank you to the remaining members of my thesis committee: Claudio Kopper, Brian O'Shae, and Filomena Nunes.
You have been a great committee providing constructive feedback on this dissertation.

Thank you to the MSU postdocs Hans Niederhausen, Brian Clark, and Rob Halliday who provided substantial intellectual training and were great people to work with.

Thank you to the Los Alamos HAWC cast, Andrea Albert, Brenda Dingus, Kelly Malone and Mora Durocher for holding space for me and creating a second research home.
My experience at LANL was invaluable and left a positive, indellible mark on my experience as a grad student.

Thank you to grad students, Allison Peisker, Joe Lundeen, Jessie Micallef, and Minjin Jeong who showed me the ropes on research with HAWC and IceCube.
You provided a strong foundation for me to build on with my research.

\textbf{My Family}

I love my friends.
Thanks to everyone that helped me figure this out.
Amazing thanks to the people at LANL who supported me.
Eames, etc
Dinner Parties
Jenny and her child Kaydince
Kirsten, Pat, Andrea
Family. You're so far but so critical to my formation. Unconditional love.
